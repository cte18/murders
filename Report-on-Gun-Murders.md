## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The
original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state).

We are going to use the following library:

    ## Warning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 3.6.2

    ## Warning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 3.6.2

    ## Warning: package 'readr' was built under R version 3.6.2

    ## Warning: package 'forcats' was built under R version 3.6.2

and load the data we already wrangled:

``` r
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rate by state

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot
showing the murder rate by state:
